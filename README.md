Convert real GPX files to the extentions abomination of them known as Mercedes-Benz format 

This tool converts plain GPX files of a certain format into a version of GPX that is readable by a mercedes benz COMAND online 

only tested on the car I own , which is a C-class W205 (2014).  It works perfectly there but this tool needs adaptations to allow Openstreetmap exports
as a source of speed camera's and 30-zones.

Will document as much as I can while making it compatible.
